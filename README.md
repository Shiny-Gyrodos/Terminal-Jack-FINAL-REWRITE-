This is the fourth rewrite of my blackjack game.

It boasts EVERY SINGLE feature mentioned by Reddit comments to add (except for around five).
I'm talking deck simulation, a replay system, usage of another class, dealer ai (sort of not really), and much more.

Have fun with my objectively terrible code!
